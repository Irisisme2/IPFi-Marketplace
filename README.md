## Solution
IPFi Marketplace Dashboard utilizes blockchain, DeFi, and AI to facilitate transparent IP trading, secure collateralization, automated IP management, revenue sharing, and community engagement.

## Challenges Faced
### Challenge:
During the development process, I encountered a significant hurdle in integrating the Story Protocol API with the frontend interface. Understanding the API documentation and implementing the required endpoints for fetching and updating IP data proved to be challenging initially.

### Solution:
To address this obstacle, I dedicated time to thoroughly study the API documentation and experimented with different endpoints using tools like Postman. Additionally, I sought assistance from the Story Protocol community forums, where I received valuable guidance and insights. Through persistence, experimentation, and collaboration with the community, I successfully integrated the API into the frontend interface. This allowed for seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the project, ensuring its functionality and usability.
